 - Analyze data for the whole year, not just one specific month to get more accurate results.
 - Analyze the length of time that bikes are checked out for each type of user.
 - Analyze the average duration of a bike ride for each type of user.
 - The number of bike trips by each type of user for each hour of each day of the week.
